    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        With over a decade of experience in software engineering, 
        I specialize in backend development and DevOps, focusing on delivering scalable and reliable solutions. My journey spans multiple domains, from core banking systems in India to cutting-edge cloud migration projects in Europe. I thrive in environments where technology meets innovation, and I’m particularly passionate about transitioning legacy systems into modern infrastructures.

        At ABN AMRO in Amsterdam, I played a pivotal role in migrating their internet banking system to cloud infrastructure using Microsoft Azure, improving system reliability and scalability. My expertise includes implementing new features, refactoring legacy code, and enhancing code quality, all while ensuring robust security and disaster recovery measures.

        Previously, at CS Communications Systems GmbH in Germany, I was involved in developing full-stack web applications for the European Space Agency, managing everything from UI/UX design to backend integration. My experience extends to working with complex systems for satellite telemetry at EUMETSAT, where I was responsible for the entire software development lifecycle.

    <p>
        I hold a Master’s degree in Distributed Software Systems from Technische Universität Darmstadt, where I also focused on refactoring asynchronous systems. My passion for technology drives me to continuously learn and adapt, whether it’s mastering new tools or contributing to innovative projects.

    <p>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring music production, photography, or staying active with football and yoga. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects that push the boundaries of technology.
